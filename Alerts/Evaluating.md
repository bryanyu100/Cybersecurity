# Alert Classification

- **True Positive**: A real security incident is correctly detected. (Desired)
- **False Positive**: A harmless activity is mistakenly flagged as an incident. (Undesirable, wastes time)
- **True Negative**: No security incident occurs, and no alert is generated. (Desired)
- **False Negative**: A real security incident is missed. (Dangerous, can cause unnoticed damage)
